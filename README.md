Is a game like tamaGotchi but the character is fictitious country president. You should feed your presiGotchi because if 
presiGotchi is hungry or thirsty he will tell you whatever to get his food, somethings 
like : "I going to cut taxes" but if presigotchi is healthy he will tell something like : "I going to cut for the richest".

The main idea behind this proyect is create a statistical to know how many presigotchis has been dead by no eat by region.
